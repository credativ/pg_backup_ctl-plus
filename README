pg_backup_ctl-plus is a rewrite of the old sophisticated pg_backup_ctl script.

Compiling:

Checkout the repository:

$ git clone git@gitlab.credativ.com:bhe/pg_backup_ctl-plus.git
$ cd pg_backup_ctl-plus
$ mkdir build

pg_backup_ctl++ currently depends on the following packages:

- boost-system
- boost-filesystem
- boost-regex

(yes, you don't have a nightmare, its true, we rely on boost)

- libpopt

If everything is present, type

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

...and have fun.

Notes on OSX:

Tested with MacPorts and AppleClang C++ compiler. Other compilers
(especially the ones from MacPorts) aren't supported!.

Linux: clang/g++ seem to work
